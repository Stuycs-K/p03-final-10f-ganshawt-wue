### Project Description:

A multiplayer trivia game. Clients can either join a lobby or make a lobby. Then, clients can connect to a main server, which will then provide all clients with a given question. Each player will then answer the question, which will send their answer to the server. Once all players have answered the question, the server will send the clients the updated scores and a new question. The game will end after the lobby's selected question amount are over. The most correct answers out of the clients win.
